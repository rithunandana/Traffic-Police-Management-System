The Traffic Police Management System can be greatly improved by integrating advanced technologies that make violation tracking more efficient and user-friendly. AI-powered image processing can help analyze CCTV footage and traffic cameras to automatically detect offenses like red light violations and overspeeding. By implementing License Plate Recognition (LPR) with Optical Character Recognition (OCR), the system can accurately extract vehicle numbers, ensuring better enforcement and reducing manual effort. These enhancements not only improve accuracy but also make the system more responsive and effective in maintaining road safety.
