The Traffic Police Management System can be extended by integrating advanced technologies for better violation tracking, automation, and user convenience. To enhance violation detection, AI-powered image processing can be used to analyze CCTV footage and traffic cameras for offenses like red light violations and overspeeding. Implementing License Plate Recognition (LPR) with OCR (Optical Character Recognition) will enable automatic extraction of vehicle numbers for more accurate enforcement.
